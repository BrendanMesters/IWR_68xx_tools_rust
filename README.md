# IWR68xx Tools

**NOTE** This repository is, as of writing, still very much a work in progress and not yet ready for use.

This repository holds a set of tools I wrote to be able to work with the IWR68xx series of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave sensors from [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/sensors/mmwave-radar/overview.html)

I am not legally responsible for any usage of my code, and the usage of this code is at your own risk. Not that I think its bad code, but I want to be sure :-)

In general I would like to have a few tools setup, for translating the TLV file into a pointcloud, for reading in raw data and if possible for rendering the data to the screen as well, but we'll see how far I'll get.

I myself work with an IWR6843ISK, and my code is thus designed for this model.

I will try to update this readme with more useful information as time goes on.
